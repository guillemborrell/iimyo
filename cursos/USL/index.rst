USL Matlab Tutorial
===================

This is a short introduction to the Matlab programming language
intended for students that have never taken a basic programming
course.  The only requirement to read this tutorial is an open
mind. Matlab is useful and simple but full of subtleties.  Anyone can
write simple Matlab scripts after a couple of hours of practice but we
must have in mind that writing beautiful code means taking care of
subtleties.

We need an open mind to understand that beauty is always important.
